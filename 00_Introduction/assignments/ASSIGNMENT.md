# 3.3 Exercises
## Question 1
Write a test function t_string thatâ€™s like t_int, but tests for equality of strings. Can you write a function that produces a string form of the results like t_int did for integers?
(This is a trick question.)

So here is my understanding of this. The `t_int` function is a wrapper for performing assertions, and leverages the labeled argument `printer` which accepts the `string_to_int` in order to output the contents to the command line.

This doesn't require a change in the function because the `assert_equal` function does not appear to have a type required for the arguments.

## Question 2
Write at least five interesting tests for inorder_str.


## Question 3
Write out the substitution-based evaluation of inorder_str on a tree with at least 3 nodes.

## Question 4
Write a function size that takes a btnode and produces an integer that is the number of Nodes in the tree.

## Question 5
Write a function height that takes a btnode and produces an integer that is the height of the tree.

## Question 6
Make sure to test the above two functions.
